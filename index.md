# Introduction

Periodically, a number of "snapshots" of our data collection are complied to provide our users a dynamic web-based interface to data-driven environmental insight.  Simply put, overtime we are continually adding a number of data summaries on a (concise) web page.


# About Us

The **O**ak **R**idges **M**oraine **G**roundwater **P**rogram is an arm's-length municipal agency covering a greater portion of south-central Ontario, Canada. We maintain hydrogeologic information and host analytical tools for our 15 partners, all of which are the decision makers in need of sharing groundwater resources that often cross political divides.
