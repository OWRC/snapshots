The Oak Ridges Moraine Groundwater Program actively maintains an archive of existing numerical models called the ORMGP Model Custodianship Program. Here over 90 models have been received and checked for consistency (search for missing/corrupt files, etc.). Many have been "re-built" and re-organized from their original/delivered form into an operational file structure that is intuitive and self contained such that the sharing of the model file can be made efficiently.

For more information, download the [Guide for Actively Managing Watershed-Scale Numerical Models in Ontario](https://www.oakridgeswater.ca/_files/ugd/4a0a6e_c41c71a481ea4657806e1fbb0c912f7a.pdf)


#### Model Codes

The ORMGP is aware that consultants maintain independent workflows and internal expertise that it would be restrictive for this model custodianship program to specify the *best model code* maintained here. For this reason, and with the support of our [municipal partners](partners.html), we maintain software licenses for a variety of model codes and third-party user interfaces.  Model codes currently maintained include:

* [FEFLOW](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/feflow)
* [MODFLOW](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/modflow-and-related-programs)
* [MIKE SHE](https://www.mikepoweredbydhi.com/products/mike-she)
* [GSFLOW](https://www.usgs.gov/software/gsflow-coupled-groundwater-and-surface-water-flow-model)
* [PRMS](https://www.usgs.gov/software/precipitation-runoff-modeling-system-prms)
* [HSP-F](https://www.epa.gov/ceam/hydrological-simulation-program-fortran-hspf)
* [HydroGeoSphere](https://www.aquanty.com/hydrogeosphere)
* [Raven](http://raven.uwaterloo.ca/)


#### Map

When a model boundary polygon is `clicked` attributes of the model are displayed. Access to model reports and the files for running of the model are available to the partner agencies for any water related study. One may access the model once they've agrees to our Model Sharing Agreement, please [contact us](https://www.oakridgeswater.ca/contact-us) for more details.
