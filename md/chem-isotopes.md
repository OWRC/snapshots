&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons, but not neutrons. They share similar chemical properties but differ in mass and by extension physical properties. An isotopic signature is expressed as the ratio between the amount of various isotopes of an element. Isotopes are used as tracers for many types of investigations including, but not limited to, groundwater provenance, relative ages, recharge processes, subsurface processes, and geochemical reactions including reaction rates (Clark and Fritz, 1997). This snapshot provides a regional overview of some of the isotope data held in the ORMGP database - specifically the stable isotopes $^{18}O$ and $^2H$ (deuterium) and the radioactive isotope  $^3H$ (tritium). Within the study area tritium is used to provide an understanding regarding if groundwaters have a component recharged in modern or recent times, approximately within the last 50 years. $^{18}O$ and $^2H$ provide information regarding recharge sources and conditions such as temperature, as well as potential differences in water types and relative ages. Further information regarding the use of isotopes in water investigations are available in Clark and Fritz (1997) and Kendall and McDonnell (1998). A brief summary of historical data for the study area is included in Gerber et al., 2009.



### Isotope Measurements
In the maps below, isotope measurements currently in the ORMGP database for $^{18}O$, $^2H$ (Deuterium) and $^3H$ (tritium) are plotted. The isotopic data that have currently been incorporated into the ORMGP database include:

<ol>
  <li>Data from research investigations (Aravena and Wassenaar, 1993; Aravena et al., 1993; 1995; 2004; Gerber, 1999; Gerber and Howard, 1996);</li>
  <li>Data from landfill siting investigations (M.M. Dillon Limited, 1990; IWA, 1994a-d);</li>
  <li>Data from municipal pumping and monitoring wells (Regions of Halton, York, Peel and Durham);</li>
  <li>Data from the Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network (PGMN) operated by the Province of Ontario and Conservation Authorities;</li>
  <li>Data from the Province of Ontario Drinking Water Surveillance Program (DWSP);</li>
  <li>Data from regional groundwater quality surveys (2007-2019) conducted by the Ontario Geological Survey (Hamilton, 2021); and</li>
  <li>Data from ongoing University of Waterloo/ORMGP geochemical and isotopic analyses initiated in 2008.</li>

Figure 4: $\delta$ $^2H$ versus $\delta$ $^{18}O$. GMWL = Global Meteoric Water Line from Craig, 1961. LMWL = Local Meteoric Water Line (Simcoe, Ontario) from Fritz et al., 1987. Study area results occur above both the GMWL and LMWL due to deuterium enrichment from processes associated with Great Lakes humidity and vapour exchange (Gat et al., 1994).
