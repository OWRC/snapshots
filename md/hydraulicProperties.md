&nbsp;&nbspThe ORMGP is actively compiling hydrogeologic parameter estimates (e.g., porosity, specific capacity, storativity, transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity) into the program's database. To date, activities have focussed on collation of hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific capacity (SC) estimates. The specific capacity estimates are being extended into estimates of transmissivity (T) and hydraulic conductivity (K) utilizing the methodology of Bradbury and Rothschild (1985). Further information of methodology is included in the program's database manual (ADD LINK TO DB MANUAL).

<ol>
  <li>K_ms - estimates of hydraulic conductivity from slug tests on piezometers/wells;</li>
  <li>SC - specific capacity (pumping rate/maximum drawdown) estimates from data obtained during short-term pumping tests (<4 hours) conducted by well drillers following well installation;</li>
  <li>T_sc - Transmissivity estimates from specific capacity (SC) estimates according to the methodology of Bradbury and Rothschild (1985) which allows for corrections for partial penetration of well screen and incorporates estimates of formation thickness;</li>
  <li>K_sc - estimates of hydraulic conductivity from specific capacity (SC) estimates utilizing methodology of Bradbury and Rothschild (1985);</li>
  <li>T_sc_screen - estimates of Transmissivity from specific capacity (SC) estimates utilizing methodology of Bradbury and Rothschild (1985). The formation thickness is taken as the screen length; and</li>
  <li>K_sc_screen - estimates of hydraulic conductivity from specific capacity (SC) estimates utilizing methodology of Bradbury and Rothschild (1985). The formation thickness is taken as the screen length.</li>
