  The ORMGP is actively compiling hydrogeologic parameter estimates (e.g., porosity, specific capacity, storativity, transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity) into the program's database. To date, activities have focussed on collation of hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific capacity (SC) estimates. The specific capacity estimates are being extended into estimates of transmissivity (T) and hydraulic conductivity (K) utilizing the methodology of Bradbury and Rothschild (1985). Further information of methodology is included in the program's database manual (ADD LINK TO DB MANUAL).
