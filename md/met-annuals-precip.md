This snapshot provides a re,gional overview of the climate data held in the ORMGP, and allows for longterm average temperature and precipitation values to be quickly viewed across the study area.  For the ORMGP study area, the presented values can be considered to be an update from the last comprehensive overview of Ontario's climate data, which was prepared in 1980 by the then Ministry of Natural Resources (Brown, 1980).  This report is held in the ORMGP Library and can be viewed by program partners here (Folder 27133).  The temperature and precipitation data held in the ORMGP are updated on a nightly basis from Environment Canada's website.

In the upper map, the active climate satations are colour coded based on the long term average precipitation. Stations with the greatest annual average pprecipitation, of greater than 1,100 mm/yr are found inland from Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario in the north parts of the ORMGP study area.  Stations with the lowest precipitation, (of around 700 mm/yr) are generally found along the Lake Ontario shoreline.

### Data processing
In the map below, climate stations having recorded precipitation or temperature data for at least 80% of the past 10 years are shown.

Precipitation is summed and air temperature is averaged for every water year (Oct-Sept).  Minimum, mean, and maximum values of these annual sums/averages are posted once a station is `clicked`.
