Percentage Water Demand: an estimation of the percentage of the water supply that is demanded consumptively by water users.

- The Tier 1 assessment will consider both current conditions as well as a 25-year future demand scenario.

## Water Supply Estimation

$$ \text{Inputs}=\text{Outputs}+\text{change in storage} $$

$$
    Q_\text{P}+Q_\text{in}=Q_\text{RO}+Q_\text{E}+Q_\text{R}+Q_\text{GT}+Q_\text{ST}+Q_\text{out}+\Delta S
$$

> In a basin where little groundwater pumping occurs and there are no significant groundwater flows into or out of the basin, the annual recharge can be equated with groundwater discharge (depending on the size of study area and the nature of the groundwater flow system). In that case, estimates of actual evapotranspiration can also be made as the difference between average annual precipitation and mean annual streamflow. These types of broad water budget calculations should be performed on larger gauged basins where local hydrologic factors are less important. pg.119

$$ Q_\text{R} \approx Q_\text{GD} $$

$$ Q_\text{E} \approx Q_\text{P}-Q_\text{SW} $$

Assume for a long-term average

$$ \Delta S \approx 0 $$

All together, simplified

- negligeable takings
- negligeable GW exchange

$$
    Q_\text{RO} \approx Q_\text{SW}-Q_\text{GD}
$$
