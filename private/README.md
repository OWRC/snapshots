# Snapshots 

Contained here are mostly a set of R-markdown _(*.Rmd)_ used to generate the "snapshots" in html format and placed in the `/md` floder. 

The area should be kept private (hidden from public) as there could be sensitive information within (logins, etc.).

> was `snapshots-private` (now an archived repo), prior to that `snapshots-external`.
